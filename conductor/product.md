# Product Definition: Poker Equity Engine

## Initial Concept
A high-performance poker equity calculation engine with multiple implementation strategies (base Python, NumPy, multiprocessing, and future C++ optimizations).

## Product Vision
The Poker Equity Engine is a showcase of sophisticated software engineering, designed to demonstrate mastery over high-performance C++ programming, efficient systems architecture, and modern full-stack development. It serves both as a professional portfolio piece and an educational tool for exploring poker theory through simulation.

## Target Audience
- **Prospective Employers:** Engineering managers looking for evidence of methodical performance optimization, benchmarking rigor, and systems-level proficiency.
- **Poker Students:** Individuals using simulations to understand the mathematical foundations of effective poker decision-making.
- **Software Engineers:** Developers interested in hybrid architectures (Python/C++ interop) and real-time telemetry systems.

## Key Features
- **High-Performance C++ Core:** Multiple execution modes including base, SIMD, and multi-threaded implementations to maximize hardware utilization.
- **Real-Time Telemetry Dashboard:** A live view of engine performance, displaying metrics such as simulations per second, CPU/Memory utilization, and convergence rates.
- **Interactive Monte Carlo Visualizers:** Real-time UI components that show how probabilities converge as more simulations are processed, providing an intuitive understanding of statistical confidence.
- **Hybrid Architecture:** A clean separation of concerns using FastAPI for job orchestration, React for a modern user experience, and shared memory for ultra-low latency data transfer between Python and C++.
- **Benchmarking Suite:** A built-in "Race Mode" to compare performance across different implementation strategies (e.g., Python vs. C++ Threaded).

## Engineering Rigor (Success Metrics)
- **Methodical Benchmarking:** Every optimization must be backed by reproducible performance data.
- **Systematic Architecture:** Clear documentation of the shared memory protocol and inter-process communication.
- **Robustness:** Comprehensive test coverage across the Python API and the C++ simulation core.
- **Engagement:** A highly interactive UI that makes complex statistical simulations accessible and engaging.
